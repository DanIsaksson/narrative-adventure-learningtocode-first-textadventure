Where are we at in the plans etc.?

**Cursor**

To determine our current position, I will consult the plan we have laid out.

Based on the study plan, we have completed the first four phases, concluding with the implementation of collections and control flow. The next stage is "Phase 4: Refactoring for a Scalable World," which focuses on Object-Oriented principles.

I will now check the immediate next steps.

We have completed the first three phases of our plan, building the basic structure and interactivity of the game.

According to the plan, we are now in **Phase 4: Refactoring for a Scalable World**. The goal of this phase is to apply Object-Oriented principles to make the code more organized and flexible. The first step involves using an `abstract` class to create a universal blueprint for all items in the game.

Currently, any `Item` object can be created directly. However, an "item" in the abstract sense doesn't have a specific use, only specific *types* of items do (like a key or a potion).

How can we change the `Item` class to serve as a template that cannot be created on its own, but instead forces derived classes like `Key` to define their own specific `Use` behavior?

Okay, I have located the `Item.cs` file. I will now read its contents.

My apologies, I made an error in reading the file. Let me try that again.

It appears the `next_steps.md` file is slightly behind your progress. The file indicates that we need to make `Item` an `abstract` class, but you have already done so.

Here is the current content of `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/models/Item.cs`:

```csharp
public abstract class Item
{
    public string? Name;
    public string? Description;
    public int HealAmount { get; set; }
}

public class  PassiveItem : Item
{
    /*

    */
}


public class HealingItem : Item
{
    public HealingItem(string Name, string Description, int HealAmount)
    {
        this.Name = Name;
        this.Description = Description;
        this.HealAmount = HealAmount;
    }

    public void Use(Player player)
    {
        this.Name = Name;
        this.HealAmount = HealAmount;

        player.Health += HealAmount;
    }

}
```

I see that `HealingItem` has a `Use` method, but the base `Item` class does not. This means a class like `PassiveItem` can exist without having any `Use` functionality, and the compiler will not complain.

This brings us to the core goal of this refactoring step: ensuring a consistent structure for all items.

Given this, what can you add to the `abstract Item` class to *force* every single class that inherits from it to implement its own version of a `Use` method?

```csharp
public abstract class Item
{
    public string? Name;
    public string? Description;
    public int HealAmount { get; set; }
}

public class  PassiveItem : Item
{
    /*

    */
}


public class HealingItem : Item
{
    public HealingItem(string Name, string Description, int HealAmount)
    {
        this.Name = Name;
        this.Description = Description;
        this.HealAmount = HealAmount;
    }

    public void Use(Player player)
    {
        this.Name = Name;
        this.HealAmount = HealAmount;

        player.Health += HealAmount;
    }

}
```

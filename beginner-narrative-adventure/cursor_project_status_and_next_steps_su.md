**User**

@/lesson_1 Alright, where are we at in this project?`Give me a quick summary of what code we're using, its utility, and then a sequence on what we're doing now/next. Use @study_plan.md and @next_steps.md for reference.

---

**Cursor**

Of course. Let's get a handle on where we are. First, I'll review the project files to see what code we have so far.

Okay, I see the file structure. We have a `Program.cs` which is likely the main entry point, an empty `Player.cs` file, and a `ChoiceHelper.cs`. There's also an `areas` directory.

I'll read `Program.cs` to understand the core logic of the game.

Okay, I've reviewed `Program.cs`. It looks like the core of the game is a state machine, using a `GameState` enum and a `switch` statement inside the main game loop to manage what's currently happening. It seems to handle the game's introduction and then transitions to a central room state where the player can choose to investigate different objects.

I also noticed you have two `Main()` methods in `Program.cs`, which will cause a compiler error. We'll need to clean that up.

Now, I'll examine `ChoiceHelper.cs` to see how it helps manage the player's choices.

I see what `ChoiceHelper.cs` does. It's a static helper class that presents the player with a menu of things to investigate in the room and returns the corresponding `GameState` based on their choice. This is a clean way to handle the branching logic.

The main loop in `Program.cs` then calls an `Investigate()` method on a specific class (like `invBed`, `invDrawer`, etc.) depending on the state returned by the `ChoiceHelper`. I assume these classes are defined in the `areas` directory.

Let's look inside the `areas` directory and inspect one of those files to confirm the pattern.

Okay, that confirms it. The `areas` directory holds a separate file for each interactive element in the room.

I'll read `invBed.cs` to understand the common structure for these "investigation" classes. This should be the last piece of the puzzle needed to give you a full summary.

Excellent. I have a clear picture of the project now. Here’s the summary of our current status and the path forward.

### Code Summary & Utility

Our project, `CrimsonRoom`, is a text-based adventure game. The code is structured as a simple **state machine**.

1.  **`Program.cs`**: This is the heart of the game. It contains the main game loop (`while`) and uses a `switch` statement to control the game's flow based on the current `GameState` (an `enum`). It's responsible for moving the player between different states, such as the intro, the main room, and investigating specific objects.
    *   **Note**: There's currently a compiler error in this file because it has two `Main()` methods. We'll need to merge and clean that up.

2.  **`ChoiceHelper.cs`**: This is a utility class that handles player input. When the player is in the center of the room, this class displays a menu of objects to investigate and translates the player's choice (`A`, `B`, `C`...) into the next `GameState` for the main loop.

3.  **The `areas/` directory**: This folder contains several files like `invBed.cs`, `invClock.cs`, etc. Each of these is a simple, static class with one job: to describe what happens when the player investigates that specific object.

4.  **`Player.cs`**: This file has been created but is currently empty.

The utility of this setup is its simplicity. It gives us a basic, working game loop where a player can navigate and interact with a static world. It neatly separates the "what can I do?" logic (`ChoiceHelper`) from the "what happens when I do it?" logic (the `areas` files).

### Current Status & Next Steps

According to our `study_plan.md`, we have successfully completed **Phase 1: Your Developer Cockpit**. We have a local C# project and the beginnings of a game structure.

We are now at the start of **Phase 2: Building the World**. Our immediate goals, as outlined in `next_steps.md`, are:

1.  **Flesh out the `Player`**: Our first step is to give the player substance. We need to edit `Player.cs` to create a proper `class` with `Name` and `Health` properties, along with a constructor. This introduces the core concept of using objects to represent entities in our world.

2.  **Practice with More Classes**: To reinforce the concept, we'll create a couple more simple classes (the plan suggests `Potion` and `Door`) to get comfortable with the syntax.

3.  **Organize with Methods**: We'll then move on to refactoring our code by creating dedicated methods for specific actions, like a `DisplayRoomInfo()` method, to make `Program.cs` cleaner and more organized.

After that, we'll be ready to tackle the main game loop, inventories, and making the world truly interactive in Phase 3.

**User**

Alright, let's move on with the next step then. What should I do?

---

**Cursor**

```plaintext
{
  "tool_name": "edit_file",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Player.cs",
    "content": "public class Player\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public int Health { get; set; }\n\n    public Player(string name, int health)\n    {\n        Name = name;\n        Health = health;\n    }\n}"
  }
}
```

Excellent. Let's tackle the first item in "Phase 2".

According to our plan, the next step is to define what a "Player" is in our game. We'll do this by fleshing out the `Player.cs` file. This class will act as a blueprint for our player character.

We will add two properties:
*   `Name` (a string to hold the player's name)
*   `Health` (an integer for hit points)

We'll also add a **constructor**, which is a special method that runs when we create a new `Player` object, to set these initial values.

Here's the code for `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Player.cs`:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Player.cs
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
    }
}
```

This gives us a reusable, well-defined `Player` object that we can start using in our game logic. Once you apply this change, we can move on to the next task.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
    }
}
```

---

**User**

Alright, so what here is a constructor? And are we defining the instance of Player class within itself here using public Player(string name, int health){}?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent questions. You've hit on one of the most fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming: the difference between a **class** (a blueprint) and an **object** (an instance, the thing you build from the blueprint).

### What is the constructor?

The constructor is this specific piece of code:

```csharp
public Player(string name, int health)
{
    this.Name = name;
    this.Health = health;
}
```

A constructor is a special method in a class that gets called automatically whenever you create a new **instance** of that class. You can recognize it because:

1.  It has the **exact same name** as the class (`Player`).
2.  It has **no return type**—not even `void`.

Its one and only job is to initialize the new object, ensuring it has all the starting values it needs to be in a valid state. In our case, it guarantees that every new `Player` object will have a `Name` and a `Health` value right from the moment it's created.

### Are we defining the instance here?

This is the key part of your question. No, we are **not** defining an instance of the `Player` class within itself.

Think of the `public class Player { ... }` block as a **blueprint**. It describes what a `Player` *is* and how to build one. The constructor is the "assembly instructions" part of that blueprint.

You use this blueprint to create actual, usable `Player` objects (the "instances") elsewhere in your code, typically with the `new` keyword.

For example, in our `Program.cs` file, we might do this:

```csharp
// Use the Player blueprint to create an actual player object (an instance)
Player mainCharacter = new Player("Corvin", 100); 

// Now we can use the object and its properties
Console.WriteLine($"Welcome, {mainCharacter.Name}!");
Console.WriteLine($"Your health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
```

So, to summarize:

*   **`class Player { ... }`**: This is the **blueprint**.
*   **`public Player(...) { ... }`**: This is the **constructor** (the assembly instructions in the blueprint).
*   **`new Player("Corvin", 100)`**: This is the action of **building an instance** (an object) from the blueprint.

You're defining the *rules* for creating an object, not creating the object itself. It's a crucial distinction.

```csharp
public Player(string name, int health)
{
    this.Name = name;
    this.Health = health;
}
```

```csharp
// Use the Player blueprint to create an actual player object (an instance)
Player mainCharacter = new Player("Corvin", 100); 

// Now we can use the object and its properties
Console.WriteLine($"Welcome, {mainCharacter.Name}!");
Console.WriteLine($"Your health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
```

---

**User**

how does one identify a constructor?

---

**Cursor**

Excellent question. You can identify a constructor by looking for two very specific and non-negotiable rules.

Here are the two key identifiers:

### 1. It has the exact same name as the class.

This is the biggest giveaway. A constructor's name must match the class name, including casing.

```csharp
public class Car // The class name is "Car"
{
    // This is the constructor because its name is also "Car"
    public Car() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("A new car has been created!");
    }
}
```

### 2. It has no return type.

This is what makes it unique from a regular method. There is nothing between the access modifier (`public`) and the name—not `void`, not `int`, not `string`, nothing at all.

Let's compare it to a regular method in our `Player` class:

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // IDENTIFIER 1: Name "Player" matches class name "Player"
    // IDENTIFIER 2: No return type here ------v
    public Player(string name)
    {
        this.Name = name;
    }

    // This is a METHOD, not a constructor.
    // It has a return type (void)
    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

---

So, the foolproof way to spot a constructor is to look for a method-like block of code that **has the same name as its class** and **lacks a return type**.

Whenever you see the `new` keyword used to create an object, you know a constructor is being called:

```csharp
// This line of code finds the constructor in the Player class
// that takes one string argument and calls it.
Player myPlayer = new Player("Gandalf"); 
```

```csharp
public class Car // The class name is "Car"
{
    // This is the constructor because its name is also "Car"
    public Car() 
    {
        Console.WriteLine("A new car has been created!");
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // IDENTIFIER 1: Name "Player" matches class name "Player"
    // IDENTIFIER 2: No return type here ------v
    public Player(string name)
    {
        this.Name = name;
    }

    // This is a METHOD, not a constructor.
    // It has a return type (void)
    public void TakeDamage(int amount)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

```csharp
// This line of code finds the constructor in the Player class
// that takes one string argument and calls it.
Player myPlayer = new Player("Gandalf"); 
```

---

**User**

The latest example there is an instancing of the Player class right?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you are exactly right. That is a perfect example of **instancing** the `Player` class.

Let's break that line down: `Player myPlayer = new Player("Gandalf");`

1.  **`Player myPlayer`**: This part **declares** a variable. It's like telling the compiler, "I'm going to need a box that is specifically shaped to hold a `Player` object, and I'm going to label that box `myPlayer`."

2.  **`new Player("Gandalf")`**: This is the **instantiation** part.
    *   The `new` keyword is the command to build a brand new object in memory.
    *   `Player("Gandalf")` calls the constructor of the `Player` class and passes `"Gandalf"` as the argument for the `name` parameter.
    *   The result is a complete, ready-to-use `Player` object.

3.  **`=`**: The assignment operator takes the newly created `Player` object from the right side and stores it in the `myPlayer` variable on the left side.

So, "instancing a class" is the official term for the process of creating an object (an instance) from a class (a blueprint). You nailed it.

---

**User**

I would like the player to have an inventory, how would I go about that? Reference the relevant material @C# in a nutshell ./resources/backup/C# in a Nutshell.

---

**Cursor**

That's a great next step. An inventory is a perfect use case for a **collection**, which is a type of object designed specifically to hold other objects.

Your reference to "C# in a Nutshell" is spot on. The concept you're looking for is covered in the "Collections" chapter. The best tool for this job from the .NET collections library is a `List<T>`.

### What is `List<T>`?

Think of `List<T>` as a smart, resizable container.

*   The `List` part is the container itself.
*   The `<T>` is a placeholder where you define the **type** of items the list will hold.
*   It automatically grows as you add items, so you don't need to worry about its size.

For our inventory, we can start by making a list that holds `string`s, where each string is the name of an item. So we'll use `List<string>`.

### How to Add it to the `Player`

We'll add a new property to our `Player.cs` file. This property will be an `Inventory`.

Here's how we'll modify the `Player.cs` file:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Player.cs
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public List<string> Inventory { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        this.Inventory = new List<string>(); // Initialize the inventory as a new, empty list
    }
}
```

### Key Changes Explained:

1.  **`public List<string> Inventory { get; set; }`**: We've added a new public property named `Inventory`. Its type is `List<string>`, meaning it's a list that can only hold strings.

2.  **`this.Inventory = new List<string>();`**: This is a crucial line we've added to the constructor. When a new `Player` object is created, this line creates a *new, empty list* and assigns it to the `Inventory` property. This ensures that every player starts with a non-null, ready-to-use inventory.

Now, elsewhere in our code, we could add items to the inventory like this:

```csharp
// Assuming 'mainCharacter' is an instance of our Player
mainCharacter.Inventory.Add("a rusty key");
mainCharacter.Inventory.Add("a silver locket");
```

This is the foundation for our inventory system. Later, as our game gets more complex, we could change from `List<string>` to `List<Item>` once we have a proper `Item` class, just as our `study_plan.md` hints at for Phase 3.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public List<string> Inventory { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        this.Inventory = new List<string>(); // Initialize the inventory as a new, empty list
    }
}
```

```csharp
// Assuming 'mainCharacter' is an instance of our Player
mainCharacter.Inventory.Add("a rusty key");
mainCharacter.Inventory.Add("a silver locket");
```

---

**User**

What is { get; set; } ?

---

**Cursor**

That is one of the most common and useful pieces of syntax in C#. `{ get; set; }` defines a **Property** on a class.

Think of a property as a smart, public-facing "sign" for a private, internal "storage box."

*   `get` is the part that lets other code **read** the value from the storage box.
*   `set` is the part that lets other code **write** a new value into the storage box.

Let's break it down.

### The Old, Manual Way (The "Longhand")

Before this shortcut existed, you had to do everything manually. To store the player's name, you would write this:

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // 1. A private "backing field" to actually store the data.
    // It's private so no one outside the class can mess with it directly.
    private string _name;

    // 2. A public "getter" method to read the data.
    public string GetName()
    {
        return _name;
    }

    // 3. A public "setter" method to change the data.
    public void SetName(string newName)
    {
        _name = newName;
    }
}
```

To use this, your code would look like: `myPlayer.SetName("Bob");` and `string currentName = myPlayer.GetName();`. This is clumsy.

### The C# Property Way (The Shorthand)

C# introduced properties to make this pattern much cleaner. The syntax `{ get; set; }` is called an **auto-implemented property**.

When you write this:

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

You are telling the C# compiler to do all of that "longhand" work for you automatically:

1.  The compiler secretly creates a private backing field for you (you can't see it or access it, but it's there!).
2.  It creates the public `get` accessor that returns the value from that secret field.
3.  It creates the public `set` accessor that assigns a new value to that secret field.

It's pure syntactic sugar—a shortcut that cleans up your code dramatically while doing the exact same thing under the hood. It turns three separate pieces of code into one simple, readable line.

So, when we write:

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // This simple line gives us a readable, writable Name property.
    public string Name { get; set; } 
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public List<string> Inventory { get; set; }
}
```

We are creating three public properties, each with a hidden private field, and each with a public getter and setter, all with just three lines of code. This is the standard, preferred way to define properties in modern C#.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // 1. A private "backing field" to actually store the data.
    // It's private so no one outside the class can mess with it directly.
    private string _name;

    // 2. A public "getter" method to read the data.
    public string GetName()
    {
        return _name;
    }

    // 3. A public "setter" method to change the data.
    public void SetName(string newName)
    {
        _name = newName;
    }
}
```

```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```

```csharp
public class Player
{
    // This simple line gives us a readable, writable Name property.
    public string Name { get; set; } 
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public List<string> Inventory { get; set; }
}
```

---

**User**

Alright, thanks for the info. Now I've lost myself a little bit, so what were we doing and what's next?

---

**Cursor**

No problem, it's easy to get lost in the details. Let's zoom back out.

### Where We Are

We just finished the first task of **Phase 2** from our `study_plan.md`. We successfully defined a blueprint for our player by creating the `Player` class in `Player.cs`. It now has:
*   Properties for `Name`, `Health`, and `Inventory`.
*   A constructor to initialize a new player object.

We took a small detour to clarify what constructors and properties (`{ get; set; }`) are, which is essential knowledge.

### What's Next

According to our `next_steps.md`, the very next task is a practice exercise to make sure the concept of creating classes sticks.

**Our goal**: Write two more simple classes to serve as blueprints for other things in our world.

Specifically, the plan calls for us to:
1.  Create a **`Potion`** class.
2.  Create a **`Door`** class.

Just like with the `Player` class, each of these new classes should have **at least two properties** and a **constructor** to initialize them. For example, a `Potion` could have a `Name` (e.g., "Healing Potion") and a `HealingAmount` (an integer). A `Door` could have a `Color` (a string) and a `IsLocked` (a boolean `true`/`false`) status.

This is a repetition exercise. It's designed to give you hands-on practice with the class/property/constructor pattern before we start weaving these objects into the main game logic.

How does that sound? We can start with the `Potion` class first.

---

**User**

Let's see I get this correctly:

public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
     {
          this.color = "pale white";
          this.lockStatus = true;
     }

^ This section instantiates a version of the public door class, and announces that it uses the variables color and lockStatus from this class. Then inside of the brackets we define how those pieces are used in this instance.

---

**Cursor**

You are very close! You've correctly identified all the right pieces, but let's refine the description of what's happening. This is a common point of confusion, and you're asking the perfect question to clear it up.

Let's look at your code and your explanation.

**Your Code:**
```csharp
public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
{
     this.color = "pale white"; // this.color should be this.Color for properties
     this.lockStatus = true;    // this.lockStatus should be this.LockStatus
}
```

**Your Explanation:**
> "This section instantiates a version of the public door class, and announces that it uses the variables color and lockStatus from this class. Then inside of the brackets we define how those pieces are used in this instance."

Let's break that down.

### Correction 1: Blueprint vs. Instance

*   **Your thought:** "This section instantiates a version..."
*   **Correction:** This section **defines the rules for instantiation**. It's the constructor, which is part of the blueprint (`class`). The *actual instantiation* happens later, when we call `new Door(...)`.

Think of it like a recipe. This code is you *writing down the recipe*. The instantiation is when you *follow the recipe* to actually bake the cake.

### Correction 2: Using the Inputs (Parameters)

This is the most important part.

*   **Your thought:** "...it uses the variables color and lockStatus from this class."
*   **Correction:** The `(string color, bool lockStatus)` part declares **input parameters**. Think of them as delivery instructions. When someone wants to create a `Door` object, they *must provide* a string and a boolean.

However, inside your constructor, you are **ignoring** those inputs. Your code always sets the door's color to `"pale white"` and its lock status to `true`, no matter what values were passed in.

It's like ordering a pizza and saying "I want pepperoni," but the chef ignores you and makes a cheese pizza every single time.

### The Correct Way to Use Constructor Parameters

The job of the constructor is to take the input parameters and assign them to the class's properties.

Here is the corrected version that does what you intend:

```csharp
public class Door
{
    // The properties that every Door object will have
    public string Color { get; set; }
    public bool IsLocked { get; set; }

    // The constructor
    public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
    {
        // Take the 'color' value that was passed in and assign it
        // to THIS object's 'Color' property.
        this.Color = color; 

        // Take the 'lockStatus' value that was passed in and assign it
        // to THIS object's 'IsLocked' property.
        this.IsLocked = lockStatus;
    }
}
```

**Explanation of `this.Color = color;`**

*   `this.Color`: The `this` keyword refers to "this specific object that is being created right now." `this.Color` means the `Color` property of the new `Door` instance.
*   `= color;`: The `color` on the right side refers to the `color` **parameter** that was passed into the constructor.

So, when you later write:

```csharp
// INSTANTIATION: Following the blueprint to create two different objects
Door frontDoor = new Door("Oak Brown", true);
Door backDoor = new Door("Steel Gray", false);
```

*   The `frontDoor` object will have its `Color` property set to `"Oak Brown"` and `IsLocked` to `true`.
*   The `backDoor` object will have its `Color` property set to `"Steel Gray"` and `IsLocked` to `false`.

You've correctly defined a reusable blueprint that can create unique and different doors.

```csharp
public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
{
     this.color = "pale white"; // this.color should be this.Color for properties
     this.lockStatus = true;    // this.lockStatus should be this.LockStatus
}
```

```csharp
public class Door
{
    // The properties that every Door object will have
    public string Color { get; set; }
    public bool IsLocked { get; set; }

    // The constructor
    public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
    {
        // Take the 'color' value that was passed in and assign it
        // to THIS object's 'Color' property.
        this.Color = color; 

        // Take the 'lockStatus' value that was passed in and assign it
        // to THIS object's 'IsLocked' property.
        this.IsLocked = lockStatus;
    }
}
```

```csharp
// INSTANTIATION: Following the blueprint to create two different objects
Door frontDoor = new Door("Oak Brown", true);
Door backDoor = new Door("Steel Gray", false);
```

**User**

In what circumstances exactly, are get; set; used? Is it by the app user or the developers coming in to instantiate an boject or something?

---

**Cursor**

That's a fantastic question that gets to the very heart of *why* properties exist. You're right to ask who the "user" is.

The short answer is: **`{ get; set; }` is a tool for developers. It is used by *your own code* to read and write an object's data in a controlled way.**

The end-user of your application (the person playing the game) will never see or interact with `{ get; set; }`. They just see the results of it, like their health displayed on the screen or a door opening.

Let's break down the circumstances with a practical example.

Imagine a `Player` object in our game.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

---

### When `get` is Used (Reading the Data)

You use the `get` part of the property anytime your code needs to **ask for the current value** of an object's state.

**Circumstance 1: Displaying information to the user.**
Your game loop needs to show the player's health.

```csharp
// Somewhere in your code, you have a player object
Player mainCharacter = new Player(100, "Adventurer");

// We are now USING THE GETTER for mainCharacter.Health
Console.WriteLine($"Your current health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
// Output: Your current health is: 100
```
When your code executes `mainCharacter.Health`, it's invoking the `get` accessor to retrieve the value from the secret backing field.

**Circumstance 2: Using the value in a logical check.**
You want to check if the player is alive.

```csharp
// USING THE GETTER to make a decision
if (mainCharacter.Health <= 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You have died.");
}
```

---

### When `set` is Used (Writing the Data)

You use the `set` part of the property anytime your code needs to **change or assign a value** to an object's state.

**Circumstance 1: Initializing the object (often in a constructor).**
When we create a new player, we need to give them starting health.

```csharp
public Player(int startingHealth, string playerName)
{
    // We are now USING THE SETTER for the Health property
    this.Health = startingHealth; 
    
    // USING THE SETTER for the Name property
    this.Name = playerName;
}
```

**Circumstance 2: Updating the state during gameplay.**
The player gets hit by a trap and loses 10 health.

```csharp
// First, we GET the current health
int currentHealth = mainCharacter.Health; // Getter is used here

// Then, we SET the new health
mainCharacter.Health = currentHealth - 10; // Setter is used here

// Now if we GET it again...
Console.WriteLine($"Your new health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
// Output: Your new health is: 90
```

### Why Not Just Use Public Fields?

This system gives you, the developer, immense **control**. `{ get; set; }` is the simplest form, but you can make it more complex. For example, you can create a read-only property:

```csharp
// You can GET this from anywhere, but you can only SET it from inside the Player class itself.
public int Id { get; private set; } 
```

Or you can add logic inside the `set`:

```csharp
private int _health;
public int Health
{
    get { return _health; }
    set 
    {
        if (value < 0) // "value" is a special keyword inside a setter
        {
            _health = 0; // Don't allow health to go below zero
        }
        else
        {
            _health = value;
        }
    }
}
```
Now, if any other part of your code tries to do `player.Health = -50;`, your property's logic will automatically correct it to `0`.

**In summary:** `{ get; set; }` creates a public "interface" for your class's data. It's a fundamental tool for developers to practice **encapsulation**—bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together, while controlling access from the outside world.

```csharp
public class Player
{
    public int Health { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
// Somewhere in your code, you have a player object
Player mainCharacter = new Player(100, "Adventurer");

// We are now USING THE GETTER for mainCharacter.Health
Console.WriteLine($"Your current health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
// Output: Your current health is: 100
```

```csharp
// USING THE GETTER to make a decision
if (mainCharacter.Health <= 0)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You have died.");
}
```

```csharp
public Player(int startingHealth, string playerName)
{
    // We are now USING THE SETTER for the Health property
    this.Health = startingHealth; 
    
    // USING THE SETTER for the Name property
    this.Name = playerName;
}
```

```csharp
// First, we GET the current health
int currentHealth = mainCharacter.Health; // Getter is used here

// Then, we SET the new health
mainCharacter.Health = currentHealth - 10; // Setter is used here

// Now if we GET it again...
Console.WriteLine($"Your new health is: {mainCharacter.Health}");
// Output: Your new health is: 90
```

```csharp
// You can GET this from anywhere, but you can only SET it from inside the Player class itself.
public int Id { get; private set; } 
```

```csharp
private int _health;
public int Health
{
    get { return _health; }
    set 
    {
        if (value < 0) // "value" is a special keyword inside a setter
        {
            _health = 0; // Don't allow health to go below zero
        }
        else
        {
            _health = value;
        }
    }
}
```

**User**

Alright, I've set up the logic for @Potion.cs and @Door.cs 

---

**Cursor**

Excellent, you've created the files and written the logic. This is the perfect time to review and refine them. You've done a great job, and the logic is very close to perfect. Let's look at them together to polish them up with some standard C# conventions.

### Reviewing `Door.cs`

```csharp
public class Door
{
     public string color { get; set; }
     public bool lockStatus { get; set; }
     // ... constructor ...
}
```

This is functionally correct! The only feedback here is about **naming conventions**. In C#, the standard convention is to use **`PascalCase`** for all public properties. This is a crucial habit to build as it makes your code consistent with all other .NET code you will encounter.

Here is the revised version of `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Door.cs`:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Door.cs
public class Door
{
     public string Color { get; set; }
     public bool LockStatus { get; set; }

     public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
     {
          this.Color = color;
          this.LockStatus = lockStatus;
     }
}
```

### Reviewing `Potion.cs`

Your `Potion.cs` has two great learning opportunities.

**1. Public Field vs. Property**
You've written `public string Name;`. This creates a **public field**, which directly exposes the variable. While this works, it's generally avoided in modern C# in favor of properties (`{ get; set; }`) because properties give you more control (like making them read-only or adding logic later). We should make `Name` a property just like `HealAmount`.

**2. Constructor Logic**
In your constructor, you have `this.HealAmount = 20;`. This line ignores the `HealAmount` value that is passed into the constructor. To make the constructor dynamic and use the input, we should assign the parameter to the property.

Here is the revised version of `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Potion.cs` that applies these two fixes:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Potion.cs
public class Potion
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int HealAmount { get; set; }

    public Potion(string name, int healAmount)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.HealAmount = healAmount; // Use the value passed in
    } 
}
```
Notice I also changed the parameter to `int healAmount` (camelCase). This is another common convention to easily distinguish between a parameter (`healAmount`) and a property (`HealAmount`).

---

Great work on this. These subtle distinctions are what take you from writing code that *works* to writing code that is clean, conventional, and maintainable.

According to our `next_steps.md`, the final part of this exercise is to actually **use** these new blueprints. Our next step is to go into `Program.cs` to create instances of `Door` and `Potion` and print their properties to the console to prove they work.

```csharp
public class Door
{
     public string color { get; set; }
     public bool lockStatus { get; set; }
     // ... constructor ...
}
```

```csharp
public class Door
{
     public string Color { get; set; }
     public bool LockStatus { get; set; }

     public Door(string color, bool lockStatus)
     {
          this.Color = color;
          this.LockStatus = lockStatus;
     }
}
```

```csharp
public class Potion
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int HealAmount { get; set; }

    public Potion(string name, int healAmount)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.HealAmount = healAmount; // Use the value passed in
    } 
}
```

"This is functionally correct! The only feedback here is about naming conventions. In C#, the standard convention is to use PascalCase for all public properties. This is a crucial habit to build as it makes your code consistent with all other .NET code you will encounter." 

You mean like using different naming conventions based on whether it's Private, Public, Hidden etc.? Can you list naming conventions within C#/.NET for me to enter into a document?

---

**Cursor**

Of course. You've intuited the reason perfectly. Using consistent naming conventions is like using proper grammar; it makes your code instantly understandable to you and any other C# developer. It communicates the **intent and scope** of a variable just by looking at its name.

Here is a summary of the most important C# naming conventions, which you can copy into your notes.

---

### C#/.NET Naming Conventions

This is a general guide to the most common conventions used in the industry and by Microsoft.

| Element Type             | Convention   | Style       | Example                                     |
| :----------------------- | :----------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Class, Interface, Enum** | `PascalCase` | Noun        | `Player`, `IDamageable`, `GameState`        |
| **Public Member**        | `PascalCase` | Noun/Verb   |                                             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Property | `PascalCase` | Noun        | `public string Name { get; set; }`          |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Method   | `PascalCase` | Verb Phrase | `public void CalculateDamage()`             |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Event    | `PascalCase` | Verb Phrase | `public event EventHandler ThingHappened;` |
| **Private Member**       | `_camelCase` | Noun        | `private string _playerPassword;`           |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field    | `_camelCase` | Noun        | `private int _currentHealth;`               |
| **Local Variables**      | `camelCase`  | Noun        | `int damage = 10;` `string playerName;`      |
| **Method Parameters**    | `camelCase`  | Noun        | `void TakeDamage(int damageAmount)`         |

---

### Key Takeaways and "Why":

1.  **`PascalCase` for Public Things:** Anything that is meant to be seen and used from outside the class (like `public` methods and properties) starts with a capital letter. This is the "public-facing" convention. It signals to other developers, "This is a primary access point for this object."

2.  **`camelCase` for Internal Things:** Things that are only used *inside* a method (local variables, parameters) start with a lowercase letter. This signals, "This is a temporary, internal variable."

3.  **The `_` Prefix for Private Fields (`_camelCase`):** This is a very strong and common convention. When you see `_name` inside a class, the underscore immediately tells you, "This is a private field that belongs to the entire class instance." It helps you distinguish between a local variable (`name`) and a class field (`_name`) without having to look up their definitions.

Building the habit of following these conventions is one of the fastest ways to make your code more professional and easier to work with.

---

**User**

Alright, that makes sense. Thanks.

---

**Cursor**

You're welcome! Now that we've defined our `Door` and `Potion` blueprints and cleared up the conventions, let's complete the final step of this exercise.

It's time to actually **use** these blueprints. We'll go into `Program.cs`, create an instance of a `Door` and a `Potion`, and then print their details to the console to confirm they work as expected.

First, I need to read `Program.cs` again to see exactly where to put this new code. I remember it needed some cleanup because of a duplicate `Main` method, so I'll address that at the same time.

Okay, I've reviewed `Program.cs`. It looks like the duplicate `Main` method has already been removed, which is great. The file is clean and ready to be modified.

Now, let's complete our "Repetition Exercise" from `study_plan.md`. We will add code to the `Main` method to:
1.  **Instantiate** a `Potion` object.
2.  **Instantiate** a `Door` object.
3.  **Print** their properties to the console to verify they work correctly.

We'll place this test code right at the beginning of the `Main` method, before the game loop starts. This is just for testing; we can remove it later.

Here are the changes for `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Program.cs`:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Program.cs
// ... existing code ...
public class Program
{

	public static void Main()
	{
		// --- Class Instantiation Test ---
		// Here we use our new blueprints to create objects.
		Door mainDoor = new Door("Old Oak", true);
		Potion basicPotion = new Potion("Minor Healing Potion", 25);

		// Now we print the properties of our new objects to the console.
		Console.WriteLine($"Created a door. Color: {mainDoor.Color}, Locked: {mainDoor.LockStatus}");
		Console.WriteLine($"Created a potion. Name: {basicPotion.Name}, Heals for: {basicPotion.HealAmount}");
		Console.WriteLine("--- End of Test ---\n");
		// --- End of Test ---

		string roomName = "The Crimson Room";
		string playerName = "";
		GameState currentMode = GameState.Intro;
// ... existing code ...
```

Once you apply this, you can run the program. You should see the details of the door and potion printed out first, followed by the start of the game. This will confirm that our `Door` and `Potion` classes are working perfectly.

```csharp
// ... existing code ...
public class Program
{

	public static void Main()
	{
		// --- Class Instantiation Test ---
		// Here we use our new blueprints to create objects.
		Door mainDoor = new Door("Old Oak", true);
		Potion basicPotion = new Potion("Minor Healing Potion", 25);

		// Now we print the properties of our new objects to the console.
		Console.WriteLine($"Created a door. Color: {mainDoor.Color}, Locked: {mainDoor.LockStatus}");
		Console.WriteLine($"Created a potion. Name: {basicPotion.Name}, Heals for: {basicPotion.HealAmount}");
		Console.WriteLine("--- End of Test ---\n");
		// --- End of Test ---

		string roomName = "The Crimson Room";
		string playerName = "";
		GameState currentMode = GameState.Intro;
// ... existing code ...
```

---

**User**

Why are we writing "mainDoor" and "basicPotion" instead of "MainDoor" and BasicPotion"? I thought PascalCase applied to public methods while camelCase applied to Internal and _camelCase applied to Private?

---

**Cursor**

You are asking exactly the right questions. This gets to the core of *scope*, which is a fundamental concept in programming.

You are correct about the conventions for Public, Private, and Internal *members of a class*. However, `mainDoor` and `basicPotion` are not members of the `Program` class. They are **local variables**.

Let's clarify the distinction.

### Class Members vs. Local Variables

**1. Class Members (Fields and Properties)**

*   **Where are they declared?** Directly inside a class, but *outside* of any method.
*   **What is their purpose?** To define the state and characteristics of an object. They "live" as long as the object itself lives.
*   **Convention:** `PascalCase` for `public` members, `_camelCase` for `private` fields.

**2. Local Variables**

*   **Where are they declared?** **Inside** a method (like our `Main` method).
*   **What is their purpose?** To hold temporary information that is only needed while that one method is running. As soon as the method finishes, the local variable is destroyed.
*   **Convention:** Always `camelCase`.

### Let's Look at the Code

Here's an example that shows both side-by-side:

```csharp
public class Game
{
    // --- CLASS MEMBERS ---
    // These belong to the Game object itself. They use PascalCase or _camelCase.

    // A public property. It's part of the class's identity.
    public Player CurrentPlayer { get; set; } 
    
    // A private field for internal state.
    private bool _isLevelLoaded; 


    // --- METHOD ---
    public void StartGame()
    {
        // --- LOCAL VARIABLES ---
        // These only exist inside StartGame(). They use camelCase.

        string welcomeMessage = "Welcome to the game!";
        Console.WriteLine(welcomeMessage);

        int startingGold = 100;
        
        // 'newPlayer' is a local variable used to temporarily hold the new object
        // before we assign it to our class member.
        Player newPlayer = new Player("Hero", 100); 

        // Now we assign the object from the local variable to the class member.
        this.CurrentPlayer = newPlayer; 

        // 'startingGold' and 'welcomeMessage' are gone once this method ends.
        // But 'CurrentPlayer' lives on as part of the Game object.
    }
}
```

In our `Program.cs`, the variables `mainDoor` and `basicPotion` are declared inside the `Main()` method. They are not part of the `Program` class's long-term state. They are temporary, local variables used for the test, so they correctly follow the `camelCase` convention.

**Rule of Thumb:** Ask yourself, "Where is this variable declared?"

*   If it's **inside a method**, use `camelCase`.
*   If it's **outside a method** (but inside the class), use `PascalCase` (for public) or `_camelCase` (for private).

```csharp
public class Game
{
    // --- CLASS MEMBERS ---
    // These belong to the Game object itself. They use PascalCase or _camelCase.

    // A public property. It's part of the class's identity.
    public Player CurrentPlayer { get; set; } 
    
    // A private field for internal state.
    private bool _isLevelLoaded; 


    // --- METHOD ---
    public void StartGame()
    {
        // --- LOCAL VARIABLES ---
        // These only exist inside StartGame(). They use camelCase.

        string welcomeMessage = "Welcome to the game!";
        Console.WriteLine(welcomeMessage);

        int startingGold = 100;
        
        // 'newPlayer' is a local variable used to temporarily hold the new object
        // before we assign it to our class member.
        Player newPlayer = new Player("Hero", 100); 

        // Now we assign the object from the local variable to the class member.
        this.CurrentPlayer = newPlayer; 

        // 'startingGold' and 'welcomeMessage' are gone once this method ends.
        // But 'CurrentPlayer' lives on as part of the Game object.
    }
}
```

**User**

I'm thinking a little bit about the folder structure here. Should we make a new object folder and put potion and door inside of there?

---

**Cursor**

That is an excellent idea. You're thinking like a software architect.

Right now, our project folder looks like this:
```
CrimsonRoom/
├── Program.cs         // The main application logic
├── ChoiceHelper.cs    // A helper for player choices
├── Player.cs          // A data blueprint
├── Potion.cs          // A data blueprint
├── Door.cs            // A data blueprint
└── areas/             // A folder for location-specific logic
```

You've correctly noticed that `Player.cs`, `Potion.cs`, and `Door.cs` have a different purpose than `Program.cs` or the files in `areas/`. They don't *do* anything on their own; they just define the **data blueprints** or **models** for the objects in our game.

Grouping them together is a very common and highly recommended practice called **Separation of Concerns**.

### The Plan

1.  **Create a new folder**. A standard name for a folder that holds data blueprints like these is `Models`. This is a widely used convention in .NET development. Other good names could be `GameObjects` or `Entities`. Let's stick with `Models`.

2.  **Move the relevant files**. We would move `Player.cs`, `Potion.cs`, and `Door.cs` into the new `Models` folder.

This would make our project structure much cleaner and more intuitive:
```
CrimsonRoom/
├── Program.cs
├── ChoiceHelper.cs
├── Models/
│   ├── Player.cs
│   ├── Potion.cs
│   └── Door.cs
└── areas/
    └── ...
```

This makes it much easier to find files as the project grows. If you're looking for what defines a "thing" in the game, you look in `Models`. If you're looking for what happens in a specific place, you look in `areas`.

Since I can't directly manipulate the file system for you, I'll need you to do it. Please go ahead and create a `Models` folder inside `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom` and move `Player.cs`, `Potion.cs`, and `Door.cs` into it.

Once you've done that, let me know, and we can proceed with the next steps in our study plan.

```plaintext
CrimsonRoom/
├── Program.cs         // The main application logic
├── ChoiceHelper.cs    // A helper for player choices
├── Player.cs          // A data blueprint
├── Potion.cs          // A data blueprint
├── Door.cs            // A data blueprint
└── areas/             // A folder for location-specific logic
```

```plaintext

**User**

Alright, great. Now, you mentioned using the code in Progamrs.cs but I think I'd prefer to instance and use Potion in @invDrawer.cs whilst Door is used in @invExitDoor.cs . Can we do that? My guess is that we can since we should be able to call these public classes from otehr files beyond Program.cs right?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you are absolutely right. Your guess is 100% correct.

A `public` class is like a public blueprint. Any other piece of code in your project can use it to create an instance, no matter what file it's in.

Moving the instantiation logic from `Program.cs` into the relevant `area` files is a fantastic architectural decision. It's another example of **Separation of Concerns**:

*   `Program.cs` is the **Game Manager**; its job is to control the overall game state.
*   `invDrawer.cs` is the **Drawer Logic**; it should know everything about the drawer, including the fact that you can find a potion inside it.
*   `invExitDoor.cs` is the **Door Logic**; it should know everything about the exit door, including its color and whether it's locked.

This is a much cleaner and more scalable approach than putting all the logic in one giant file.

Let's make those changes.

### Step 1: Updating the Drawer

In `invDrawer.cs`, we will instantiate the `Potion` when the player successfully opens the drawer. I also noticed the method name in your file (`drawerInvestigate`) doesn't match the one being called in `Program.cs` (`Investigate`), which would cause an error. I'll fix that at the same time.

Here are the changes for `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/areas/invDrawer.cs`:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/areas/invDrawer.cs
// ... existing code ...
public static class invDrawer
{
    public static void Investigate()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("There's a small, unassuming wooden drawer set into a nearby desk. It looks like it hasn't been opened in years, covered in a thick layer of dust.");
        Console.WriteLine("What do you do? (Type 'Open Drawer', 'Dust', or 'Nothing')");

        string choice = Console.ReadLine();
        switch(choice)
        {
            case "Open Drawer":
                Console.WriteLine("You tug at the handle. It's stuck. With a sharp pull, it jerks open with a loud crack. Inside, you find a small, glimmering vial.");
                
                // Here we create the Potion object!
                Potion foundPotion = new Potion("Glimmering Vial", 25);
                Console.WriteLine($"You found a {foundPotion.Name}! It looks like it could heal about {foundPotion.HealAmount} health.");
                // In a real game, we would now add this 'foundPotion' to the player's inventory.
                break;

            case "Dust":
// ... existing code ...
```

### Step 2: Updating the Exit Door

For `invExitDoor.cs`, we can create a `Door` object at the beginning of the method to represent the door itself. This lets us use the object's properties to make our descriptions dynamic. I'll fix the method name here as well.

Here are the changes for `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/areas/invExitDoor.cs`:

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/areas/invExitDoor.cs
using System;

public static class invExitDoor
{
    public static void Investigate()
    {
        // Here we create the Door object to represent the state of this door.
        Door mainDoor = new Door("Reinforced Steel", true);

        Console.WriteLine($"You're facing the main door, the only visible way out. It's a heavy, {mainDoor.Color} door with multiple locks. A small slot is set at eye level.");
        Console.WriteLine("What do you want to examine? (Type 'Knob', 'Locks', 'Slot', or 'Nothing')");

        string choice = Console.ReadLine();
        switch(choice)
        {
            case "Knob":
                Console.Write("You grab the doorknob and try to turn it. ");
                if (mainDoor.LockStatus)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("It doesn't budge because it's locked. It feels solid, unmoving, and cold as ice.");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("It turns with a click! The way is open.");
                }
                break;
            
            case "Locks":
// ... existing code ...
```

### Step 3: Cleaning up `Program.cs`

Finally, we need to remove the old test code from `Program.cs` since it's no longer needed there.

I'll remove the lines we added previously.

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Program.cs
// ... existing code ...
public class Program
{

	public static void Main()
	{
		string roomName = "The Crimson Room";
// ... existing code ...
```

Once you apply these changes, the logic will be much more organized and context-aware. Great suggestion

Question regarding object logic for inventory and such. If I instance a version of the potion in invDrawer, is there a way to then transfer that into the Player.cs file (once we have the proper inventory code there)?

---

**Cursor**

Yes. That is the absolute key to making an interactive game, and you've asked the question that bridges the gap between having separate objects and having them work together.

The answer is you don't "transfer the object" in the sense of sending a copy. Instead, you **pass a reference** to the player object into the method that needs it.

Think of it like this: The `invDrawer.Investigate()` method doesn't know who is investigating it. To tell it, you need to pass the `Player` object into the method as a parameter. This gives the method a "handle" to the player, allowing it to interact with the player's inventory.

Here is the step-by-step guide to how this works.

### Step 1: Upgrade the Player's Inventory

First, our player's inventory is currently a `List<string>`. This isn't ideal. We want it to hold actual `Potion` objects, not just their names. We need to upgrade the `Player.cs` file. We also need a method to add items to the inventory.

I will modify `dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Models/Player.cs` for you.

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Models/Player.cs
// You will need to add this 'using' statement at the top
// so the Player class knows what a 'Potion' is.
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }
    
    // UPGRADE: The inventory now holds actual Potion objects.
    public List<Potion> Inventory { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        
        // UPGRADE: Initialize the list to be a list of Potions.
        this.Inventory = new List<Potion>();
    }

    // NEW METHOD: A public method to add an item to the inventory.
    public void AddItemToInventory(Potion item)
    {
        this.Inventory.Add(item);
        Console.WriteLine($"'{item.Name}' was added to your inventory.");
    }
}
```
*(Note: I am assuming you have already moved `Player.cs` to a `Models` folder. When you create `Potion.cs` and `Door.cs`, they should also be in this folder and have a `public class` definition).*

### Step 2: Modify the `Investigate` Method

Now, we change the `invDrawer.Investigate()` method so it requires a `Player` object as an argument.

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/areas/invDrawer.cs
// ... existing code ...
public static class invDrawer
{
    // The method now takes a 'player' object as a parameter.
    public static void Investigate(Player player)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("There's a small, unassuming wooden drawer...");
        // ... (rest of the description) ...

        string choice = Console.ReadLine();
        switch(choice)
        {
            case "Open Drawer":
                Console.WriteLine("...you find a small, glimmering vial.");
                
                Potion foundPotion = new Potion("Glimmering Vial", 25);
                
                // THE MAGIC HAPPENS HERE:
                // We call the method on the player object that was passed in.
                player.AddItemToInventory(foundPotion);
                break;
            // ... (other cases) ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Update the Call in `Program.cs`

Finally, we update our main game loop in `Program.cs` to pass the `Player` object when it calls `Investigate()`. First, we'll need to create a player!

```csharp:dotnetfiddle/CrimsonRoom/Program.cs
// ... existing code ...
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		// First, let's create our player instance!
		Player mainPlayer = new Player("", 100); // Name will be set in the Intro

		string roomName = "The Crimson Room";
		GameState currentMode = GameState.Intro;

		while (currentMode != GameState.Quit)
		{	
			switch(currentMode)
			{
				case GameState.Intro:
					// ... (intro dialogue) ...
					while (string.IsNullOrEmpty(mainPlayer.Name))
					{
						Console.WriteLine("\n\"Hey deadbeat. What's yer name?\"");
						mainPlayer.Name = Console.ReadLine();
						// ...
					}
					Console.WriteLine("Well then... welcome " + mainPlayer.Name + ".");
					currentMode = GameState.Center;
					break;
				
				// ... (other cases) ...

				case GameState.eDrawer:
					// Now we pass the player object to the method.
					invDrawer.Investigate(mainPlayer);
					currentMode = GameState.Center;
					break;

				// ... (other cases) ...
			}
		}
	}
}
```

### Summary - The Package Delivery

1.  The `Player` object is created in `Main()`. Think of this as your delivery person.
2.  When the game state is `eDrawer`, we call `invDrawer.Investigate()` and tell our `mainPlayer` "go investigate." We are passing a reference to the `mainPlayer` object.
3.  Inside `Investigate()`, a `Potion` object is created (the package).
4.  The method then uses its reference to the player to call `player.AddItemToInventory(foundPotion)`, effectively telling the delivery person, "put this package in your backpack."

The object is never "in" the `invDrawer.cs` file. The file just contains the instructions for creating it and handing it off to the player who is currently in that area.

```csharp
// You will need to add this 'using' statement at the top
// so the Player class knows what a 'Potion' is.
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Health { get; set; }
    
    // UPGRADE: The inventory now holds actual Potion objects.
    public List<Potion> Inventory { get; set; }

    public Player(string name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        
        // UPGRADE: Initialize the list to be a list of Potions.
        this.Inventory = new List<Potion>();
    }

    // NEW METHOD: A public method to add an item to the inventory.
    public void AddItemToInventory(Potion item)
    {
        this.Inventory.Add(item);
        Console.WriteLine($"'{item.Name}' was added to your inventory.");
    }
}
```

```csharp
// ... existing code ...
public static class invDrawer
{
    // The method now takes a 'player' object as a parameter.
    public static void Investigate(Player player)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("There's a small, unassuming wooden drawer...");
        // ... (rest of the description) ...

        string choice = Console.ReadLine();
        switch(choice)
        {
            case "Open Drawer":
                Console.WriteLine("...you find a small, glimmering vial.");
                
                Potion foundPotion = new Potion("Glimmering Vial", 25);
                
                // THE MAGIC HAPPENS HERE:
                // We call the method on the player object that was passed in.
                player.AddItemToInventory(foundPotion);
                break;
            // ... (other cases) ...

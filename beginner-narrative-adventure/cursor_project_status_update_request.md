**User**

Alright, where are we at in this project? @/CrimsonRoom Please refer to @/instructions 

---

**Cursor**

To understand our current position, it's often best to review our plans. I will start by examining your study plan.

The `study_plan.md` provides a high-level view of our curriculum. According to its progress tracker, we have completed the initial setup. However, the code you have written appears to be more advanced.

I will now examine `instructions/next_steps.md` to see if it contains more specific information about our immediate goals.

Based on `study_plan.md`, we have completed the initial project setup. The `next_steps.md` file outlines the following tasks for Phase 2:

*   Implement the `Player` class with `Name` and `Health` properties.
*   Write `Potion` and `Door` classes.
*   Create a `DisplayRoomInfo` method.

Considering the code you have already written in the `models` and `areas` directories, how would you assess the status of these tasks?

---

**User**

Yes

---

**Cursor**

I agree. Your `Player`, `Door`, and `Item` classes in the `models` directory appear to have fulfilled the initial class creation tasks, and you have implemented various methods in the `areas` directory.

Since the tasks listed in `next_steps.md` no longer reflect the current state of the project, what is the best way to keep our planning documents aligned with the work that has been completed?

---

**User**

I want to work through the steps outlined. So let's make arrangements for updating @next_steps.md and @study_plan.md in acordance to what we have accomplished. The focus for me next should be introducing new concepts with us looping back around to do repeat practices on the concepts in our new @practice_repeat_learning.md document , to make sure the project itself remains fairly clean. Don't forget to refer t the book for good direction.

---

**Cursor**

I understand your approach - you want to update the planning documents to reflect current progress, introduce new concepts systematically, and use the practice document for reinforcement exercises to keep the main project clean.

Let me examine the current code more closely to assess what has been accomplished, then update the planning documents accordingly.

Now I can see the current state clearly. You have implemented:

**Completed Concepts:**
- Classes with properties and constructors (`Player`, `Door`, `Item`)
- Enums (`GameState`)
- Switch statements (in `Program.cs` and `ChoiceHelper.cs`)
- Collections (`List<Item>` for inventory)
- Static methods and classes
- Method parameters (passing `Player` to methods)
- Raw string literals (C# 11 feature)

Looking at your current implementation and comparing it to the study plan, you've actually progressed well beyond Phase 2. You're using concepts from Phase 3 (collections, method organization) and some advanced features.

What specific new concept would you like to focus on next - should we look at error handling, file I/O, or perhaps interfaces and inheritance to make your item system more robust?

---

**User**

For this I want you to refer to the book. Based on what the book has to say about progression and its overall layout, come up with how to move forward and follow@update-plans.mdc I'll be extra clear and say [GENERATE_SOLUTION]

---

**Cursor**

Understood. I will update the planning and exercise documents based on your progress and the structure suggested by the C# Player's Guide. The focus will be on solidifying your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming, as that is the logical next step.

First, I will update your study plan to reflect the completed work and outline the upcoming phases.

## 🧠 Phase 4: Refactoring for a Scalable World (OOP Principles)
> *Goal: Apply Object-Oriented principles to make the code more organized, flexible, and scalable.*
> **Reference**: C# Player's Guide, Part 2: Object-Oriented Programming

### Feature 1: A Universal Item Blueprint
> **Need**: A common, enforceable template for all items in the game.
> **Tool**: `abstract` classes and `virtual`/`abstract` methods.
> **Reference**: C# Docs: "Abstract Classes", "Inheritance"

#### Create
```csharp
// In a new file: Item.cs
public abstract class Item
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public abstract void Use(Player player); // Every item MUST have a Use method.
}

// In a new file: Key.cs
public class Key : Item // Key inherits from Item
{
    public override void Use(Player player)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You wave the key around. It doesn't seem to do anything here.");
    }
}
```

### Feature 2: A Common Language for Actions
> **Need**: A contract that guarantees different kinds of objects can perform a similar action.
> **Tool**: Interfaces (`interface`).
> **Reference**: C# Docs: "Interfaces"

#### Use
```csharp
// In a new file: IInteractable.cs
public interface IInteractable
{
    void Interact(Player player);
}

// Update your area classes (e.g., invBed) to implement this interface.
public class Bed : IInteractable
{
    public void Interact(Player player)
    {
        // Logic for investigating the bed goes here.
    }
}
```
> **Concept**: Interfaces define *what* an object can do, not *what* an object is. This will allow us to treat all interactive objects in the room uniformly, cleaning up the main game loop significantly.

---

## 🛡️ Phase 5: Making the Game Robust (Advanced Topics)
> *Goal: Add polish and reliability to your application.*

### Feature 3: Preventing Crashes
> **Need**: To handle unexpected user input gracefully.
> **Tool**: `int.TryParse()` and `try-catch` blocks for error handling.
> **Reference**: C# Docs: "Exception Handling"

### Feature 4: Saving and Loading
> **Need**: To let the player save their progress.
> **Tool**: File I/O (`System.IO.File`).
> **Reference**: C# Docs: "File I/O"

---

## 📚 Phase 6: Exploring the .NET Toolbox (BCL)
> *Goal: Leverage the vast library of pre-built code in .NET.*

### Exploration Areas
- `System.Random`: For randomizing item locations or puzzle outcomes.
- `System.Text.StringBuilder`: For efficiently building long, complex room descriptions from multiple parts.
- `System.DateTime`: For time-based puzzles or events.
- `System.Linq`: For querying collections. Example: `player.Inventory.FirstOrDefault(item => item.Name == "rusty key");` to find an item without a loop.

```

```markdown
# 🎯 Next Steps

## Phase 4: Refactoring for a Scalable World (OOP)

Your next goal is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This will make your game's code more organized and easier to expand. We will start with `abstract` classes.

**Reading:** C# Player's Guide, Part 2: Object-Oriented Programming

### Tasks
1.  **Refactor `Item.cs` into an `abstract` class.**
    -   An `abstract` class provides a base definition but cannot be instantiated itself. It's a perfect blueprint.
    -   Add an `abstract` method to it called `public abstract void Use(Player player);`. This forces any class that inherits from `Item` to define how it is "used".

2.  **Create a specific item that inherits from `Item`.**
    -   Create a new file, `Key.cs`.
    -   The `Key` class should inherit from your new `abstract Item` class.
    -   You will be required to `override` the `Use` method. For now, just have it print a message like `"You wave the key around uselessly."`

3.  **Update `invDrawer.cs` to give the Player a `Key` instead of a `Small Potion`.**
    - This will allow us to test the new system. You will need to change this line:
    `thePlayer.PlayerInventory.Add(new Item("Small Potion", ...));`
    - To this:
    `thePlayer.PlayerInventory.Add(new Key("Old Rusty Key", "An old, heavy iron key."));`

Once these steps are done, the foundation for a much more robust item system will be in place.

```

```markdown

========== STUDENT EXERCISES ==========

### Exercise 1: Classes, Enums, and Switch Statements

**Goal**: Reinforce your understanding of creating classes, defining enums for state, and using switch statements for logic.

1.  **Create an Enum**:
    -   Define an `enum` named `MonsterType` that includes the following types: `Goblin`, `Skeleton`, `Orc`, `Slime`.

2.  **Create a Class**:
    -   Create a class named `Monster`.
    -   Give it three properties:
        -   `Name` (string)
        -   `Health` (int)
        -   `Type` (using your `MonsterType` enum)
    -   Add a constructor that accepts values for these three properties.

3.  **Write a Method with a `switch`**:
    -   Create a static method `public static void Announce(Monster monster)`.
    -   Inside this method, use a `switch` statement on `monster.Type`.
    -   For each `MonsterType`, write a different line to the console. For example:
        -   `Goblin`: "A nasty goblin appears, clutching a rusty dagger!"
        -   `Skeleton`: "A skeleton rattles its bones as it approaches."
        -   `Orc`: "An enormous orc bellows a challenge!"
        -   `Slime`: "A green slime gurgles menacingly."
        -   `default`: "A creature of unknown origin has appeared."

4.  **Test it**:
    -   In your `Program.cs` `Main` method (or a temporary new project), create a few different `Monster` instances and pass them to your `Announce` method to see the output.

```

The planning documents have been updated.

*   `instructions/study_plan.md` now reflects your completed progress and outlines a clearer path forward, focusing on Object-Oriented principles.
*   `instructions/next_steps.md` provides specific, actionable tasks for our next session on `abstract` classes.
*   `notes_and_exercises/practice_repeat_learning.md` contains a new exercise to reinforce your existing skills.

We have a clear plan. How would you like to begin with the first task in `next_steps.md`?

---

**User**

Yes

---

**Cursor**

Excellent. The first task is to refactor the `Item.cs` class to serve as an `abstract` blueprint for all items in the game. I will open the file for you.

An `abstract` class is a special kind of class that cannot be created on its own; it only exists to be inherited by other classes.

What keyword do you think is used to declare a class as `abstract`?

Based on this, what keyword do you think you need to add to the `Item` class definition to make it abstract?

---

**User**

Alright, I've changed it to: public abstract class Item

---

**Cursor**

Correct. That is the exact syntax for declaring an abstract class.

Now that `Item` is abstract, it can contain abstract members. The next step in our plan is to define a common action that all items must have. According to `next_steps.md`, we need to add an `abstract` method called `Use`.

An abstract method is a method declaration without any implementation. It defines a signature, and any non-abstract class that inherits from `Item` will be forced to provide its own implementation for that method.

Given this, how would you write the declaration for an abstract `Use` method that takes a `Player` object as a parameter and returns nothing?

---

**User**

I'm not that familiar with Use but.. hmm... and I want to note that I hope we'll dive into the meaning of inheritance etc. later.


My guess:
public abstract use Item(string Name, string Description, int HealAmount)
{ 
this.Name = Name;
this.Description = Description;
this.HealAmount = HealAmount;
}

and a variant could be 
public abstract use Item(string Name)
{
this.Name = Name;
}


---

**Cursor**

You've correctly identified the syntax for a constructor, which is a special method used to create and initialize an object. We will definitely need a constructor for our items.

However, our current task is to define an `abstract method`. The goal of an abstract method is different: it defines a capability or an action that a class *must* have, but it doesn't say *how* to do it. It leaves the implementation details to the child classes.

An abstract method declaration has two key differences from a constructor:
1.  It has a return type (for example, `void`, `int`, `string`).
2.  It has no implementation body (`{ ... }`). It simply ends with a semicolon.

The general structure is: `public abstract <return_type> <MethodName>(<parameters>);`

We will absolutely explore inheritance in more detail as we implement it. For now, given that the `Use` method should return nothing and take a single `Player` parameter, how would you write that declaration?

---

**User**

public abstract void use Item(string Name;)

---

**Cursor**

That's getting closer. You have the `public abstract void` part correct.

Now, let's refine the method's name and its parameter.

1.  A method name should describe the action it performs. You have `use Item`, but the name of the action is just "Use".
2.  The parameter list defines what information the method needs to do its job. If the action is "Use", what object does the method need to affect? For instance, if the item is a health potion, who is being healed?

Based on that, what should the method name and the parameter inside the parentheses be?

---

**User**

public abstract void Use(Player)

---

**Cursor**

Excellent. The method name is `Use`, and the type of the parameter is `Player`. That is correct.

You are just one small step away. When you declare a parameter for a method, you must give it both a type and a name so you can refer to it inside the method.

`public abstract void Use(TypeName parameterName);`

What name would you like to give the `Player` parameter?

---

**User**

public abstract void Use(Player player)?

---

**Cursor**

Precisely. `public abstract void Use(Player player)` is the correct signature.

You have correctly defined the access level, declared it abstract, specified that it returns nothing (`void`), named the method `Use`, and declared that it requires a `Player` object named `player`.

There is just one final character that every C# statement must end with. What is it?

---

**User**

public abstract void Use(Player player);

I have a vague idea that this is accurate. I understand that "public" makes the method publically available across my project, that "abstract" makes into an isolated template to be used by other non-isolated classes or methods etc., that "void" tells the compiler it doesn't need to return a value, that Use is what we name this method, BUT... 

As for (Player player) I am trying to 1) understand if this is referring to our public Player class @Player.cs and 2) the logic that informs the program that I guess... errr... how it "affects" the object, if it's looking for those health parameters or something

---

**Cursor**

Your breakdown is excellent. You are correct on all points: `public` for accessibility, `abstract` for the template, and `void` for the lack of a return value.

To address your questions:
1.  Yes, `(Player player)` is a direct reference to your `Player` class. It is a parameter, a piece of information the `Use` method requires to do its job. It's a promise that when you call `Use`, you will provide an instance of a `Player` object.

2.  You have asked the most important question: how does it know how to "affect" the object? An `abstract` method is a declaration, not an implementation. It is a rule. You have just made a rule that states: "Any class that is a type of `Item` *must* have a `Use` method, but I am not going to define what 'Use' does right here."

Think of the `Item` class as a blueprint. You have added a line to the blueprint that says, "A 'Use' button must be installed here." You have not yet wired that button to anything.

Considering that the blueprint itself contains no wiring, where must we write the specific code that defines what happens when you use a *key* versus what happens when you use a *potion*?

---

**User**

I suppose this logic means that we wouldn't be able to use Item on an enemy NPC, or other objects outside of the player right? I guess if I wanted that I'd have to make a Character class or something larger, upon which I could add sub-.classes like Player, NPC etc. and I would then write:

public abstract class Character
{
public string Name;;
public int Health;
public List<Item> Inventory {get; set;}

public Player(string? name, int health)
{
          this.Name = name;
          this.Health = health;
          this.Inventory = new List<Item>();
}

public NPC(string? name, int health)
{
this.Name = name;
this.Health = health;
this.Inventory = new List<Item>();
}
}

---

**Cursor**

You have made an outstanding logical leap. That is precisely the kind of thinking that Object-Oriented Programming is designed for.

You are correct. By defining the method as `Use(Player player)`, you are creating a contract that says this action can only be performed on a `Player` object.

Your proposed `Character` class is the perfect solution to this problem. It is a more general, or `abstract`, concept. Both `Player` and `NPC` are types of `Character`, so they could `inherit` the common properties you listed. Then, your `Use` method could be `Use(Character target)` to allow an item to affect any character in the game.

This is a powerful design pattern. For our current lesson, we will focus on the `Player`, but we have laid the groundwork for this more advanced structure.

Let's return to the `Item` blueprint. We have a rule that says "all items must have a `Use` method," but we have not defined what that method does. If the abstract `Item` class only provides the rule, where do you think we must write the specific code that defines what a `Key` does when it is used?

---

**User**

I would like to fix up what needs fixin in @Player.cs as I've gotten a bunch of new Problems

---

**Cursor**

You have correctly identified that the structure of the code is causing errors. This is a common and important step in learning object-oriented design.

The errors are happening because of a specific rule in C#. Let's look at the line `public Player(string? name, int health)`. The compiler thinks you are trying to write a method, but it is missing a return type like `void`.

However, your syntax is very close to that of a special method used to initialize objects. What do we call a special method that has no return type and must have the exact same name as the class it belongs to?

---

**User**

Maybe a constructor?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, that is exactly right. A method with no return type that shares the same name as the class is a constructor.

Now, consider the code you have written. You have a class named `Character`, but inside it, you have methods named `Player` and `NPC`.

What is the fundamental rule about the name of a constructor in relation to the name of its class?

---

**User**

It needs to  have the same name. But... we're supposed to be building methods I guess. Can I solve this by creating methods using the abstract and then a constructor based on those? I'm feel very confused as to how I can effectively label things correctly under the class Character if I can't differentiate between player and npc

---

**Cursor**

You have asked the perfect question. This is the central challenge that inheritance is designed to solve. You are correct: a constructor must have the same name as its class, which is why `public Player(...)` and `public NPC(...)` are causing errors inside the `Character` class.

The solution is not to create methods within the `Character` class. The solution is to create separate, new classes for `Player` and `NPC` that inherit from the `Character` blueprint.

We have already made `Character` an `abstract` class, which means it is a blueprint. Now, we must declare that `Player` and `NPC` are concrete implementations of that blueprint. We use a colon (`:`) for this.

```csharp
// The abstract blueprint
public abstract class Character 
{
    // Common properties...
}

// A concrete class that USES the blueprint
public class Player : Character
{
    // Player-specific things go here...
}

// Another concrete class that USES the blueprint
public class NPC : Character
{
    // NPC-specific things go here...
}
```

This structure means a `Player` *is a* `Character`, and an `NPC` *is a* `Character`.

Given this new structure, where would the constructor for the `Player` class need to be located?

```csharp
// The abstract blueprint
public abstract class Character 
{
    // Common properties...
}

// A concrete class that USES the blueprint
public class Player : Character
{
    // Player-specific things go here...
}

// Another concrete class that USES the blueprint
public class NPC : Character
{
    // NPC-specific things go here...
}
```

---

**User**

It would need to be located inside of the Player class. I've attempted to add a constructor for both NPC and Player

---

**Cursor**

Excellent. Placing the constructor for a class inside the class itself is the correct approach.

I will now read the file to see your changes.

Your new structure is a great improvement. You have correctly created the `Player` and `NPC` classes inheriting from `Character`, and you have placed a constructor inside each one.

Now, look closely at the properties inside `Character`, `Player`, and `NPC`.

`Character` has: `Name`, `Health`, `Inventory`.
`Player` has: `Name`, `Health`, `Inventory`.
`NPC` has: `Name`, `Health`, `Inventory`.

The purpose of inheritance is for a child class (like `Player`) to automatically receive all the public properties and methods of its parent (`Character`), so you do not have to write them again.

Given this, what properties in the `Player` and `NPC` classes are now redundant?

---

**User**

string, health and Inventory? Does that mean I should delete this section inside public class NPC : Character?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you are precisely right. `Name`, `Health`, and `Inventory` are redundant.

Because `Player` and `NPC` inherit from `Character`, they automatically include those public properties from the blueprint. You should remove those three property declarations from both the `Player` and the `NPC` classes.

After you do so, a new question will emerge. The constructor in the child class (e.g., `public Player(...)`) receives the initial values, but the properties themselves live in the parent `Character` class. Therefore, the child's constructor must pass the values up to the parent.

What keyword allows a constructor in a child class to call the constructor of its parent, or `base`, class?

---

**User**

I don't know

---

**Cursor**

That is perfectly fine. The keyword is `base`.

When a child class inherits from a parent, its constructor can use `: base(...)` to pass parameters up to the parent's constructor.

First, you need a constructor in the `Character` class to receive these values.
```csharp
// In Character.cs
public abstract class Character
{
    public string? Name;
    public int Health;
    public List<Item> Inventory { get; set; }

    // The base constructor
    public Character(string? name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        this.Inventory = new List<Item>();
    }
}
```

Now, the child constructor in `Player.cs` can be simplified. It just needs to pass the data along.
```csharp
// In Player.cs
public class Player : Character
{
    // The constructor calls the base constructor
    public Player(string? name, int health) : base(name, health)
    {
        // This constructor can be empty now, or do Player-specific setup.
    }
}
```
This new structure eliminates redundant code and establishes a clear hierarchy.

Can you now apply this same logic to the `NPC` class?

```csharp
// In Character.cs
public abstract class Character
{
    public string? Name;
    public int Health;
    public List<Item> Inventory { get; set; }

    // The base constructor
    public Character(string? name, int health)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Health = health;
        this.Inventory = new List<Item>();
    }
}
```

```csharp
// In Player.cs
public class Player : Character
{
    // The constructor calls the base constructor
    public Player(string? name, int health) : base(name, health)
    {
        // This constructor can be empty now, or do Player-specific setup.
    }
}
```

---

**User**

I've had a go at it. Check out @Character.cs 

---

**Cursor**

You have correctly used the `: base(name, health)` syntax. This is the right way to pass initialization data from a child class to its parent.

The `Character` constructor now takes care of three things: setting the `Name`, setting the `Health`, and initializing the `Inventory`.

Now, look closely at the code *inside* the body of your `Player` and `NPC` constructors:
`this.Inventory = new List<Item>();`

What task does this line of code perform, and do you see that same task being performed anywhere else?

---

**User**

I mean... I know that it happens in the Character abstract class but I don't understand how that information transfers into our sub-classes

---

**Cursor**

That is a fantastic question. The key is understanding the order of operations when you create a new object.

When you write `new Player("Hero", 100);`, the C# compiler performs these steps in a specific order:
1.  It sees you are calling the `Player` constructor.
2.  It sees `: base(name, health)` and immediately pauses the `Player` constructor to go run the `Character` constructor first.
3.  The `Character` constructor runs completely. It sets the `Name`, sets the `Health`, and it executes `this.Inventory = new List<Item>();`. The inventory has now been created.
4.  Only after the `Character` constructor is finished does control return to the `Player` constructor.
5.  The code inside the `Player` constructor's curly braces `{...}` is then executed.

Given this sequence, what does the line `this.Inventory = new List<Item>();` inside your `Player` constructor do to the inventory that the `Character` constructor has already created?

---

**User**

Why does it execute the inventory even if I only specify base(name, health)?

---

**Cursor**

That is a very insightful question. It highlights a core principle of how constructors and inheritance work together.

The `base(name, health)` part of the constructor declaration does not pick and choose which lines from the parent constructor to run. It is simply a way to pass the required parameters to the parent constructor. Once it is called, the *entire* body of the parent constructor executes from its opening brace `{` to its closing brace `}`.

The parent constructor's job is to ensure that a `Character` object is fully and correctly initialized before any child-specific logic runs. In our case, a "fully initialized" `Character` is defined as having a name, health, and an empty (but not null) inventory list.

So, since the entire `Character` constructor always runs first, what is the effect of having the `Player` constructor also run `this.Inventory = new List<Item>();` immediately after?

---

**User**

But like... why are those two variables "required paramters"?

---

**Cursor**

That's an excellent question that gets to the heart of class design. The parameters `name` and `health` are required because you, as the programmer, defined them as required in the `Character` constructor's signature:

`public Character(string? name, int health)`

By writing the constructor this way, you are establishing a rule. You are stating, "It is impossible to create a `Character` (or any class that inherits from it, like `Player` or `NPC`) without providing a name and a health value." This makes your code safer and more predictable. It prevents you or another programmer from accidentally creating a character with no name or health.

This was your design choice. You could have created a constructor with no parameters: `public Character() { ... }`.

What do you think would happen if you defined a parameterless constructor in `Character` and then tried to call `: base(name, health)` from the `Player` constructor?

Mmm... I dunno. I'm still very confused by why we need to have those required parameters if the whole section apparently becomes required since it'sa utomatically transferred onto a constructor and thus instance..?

---

**Cursor**

I understand the confusion. Let's separate two concepts:
1.  **Inheritance of Properties**: A child class inherits all public properties from its parent. `Player` automatically has a `Name`, `Health`, and `Inventory`. This is a blueprint relationship.
2.  **Execution of Constructors**: Constructors are not inherited; they are chained together. The child's constructor *calls* the parent's constructor.

Let's try a different perspective. Imagine the `Character` class is a factory that builds the core chassis of a car. The `Player` class is a customization shop.

*   `public Character(string modelName, int horsepower)` is the factory's work order. It says: "To build a chassis, I absolutely require a model name and a horsepower rating." Inside the factory, they stamp the name, install the engine, and also add a standard empty glove box.

*   `public Player(...) : base(modelName, horsepower)` is your order to the customization shop. You say, "I want to build a Player car." The shop says, "Great. First, I have to send an order to the factory for a chassis. What model name and horsepower should I tell them?"

The `base(...)` call is the customization shop placing the order with the factory. The factory then builds the complete chassis as specified.

The parameters are required because the factory's work order (`Character`'s constructor) demands them. The factory guarantees a complete chassis; the customization shop can then add spoilers or racing stripes.

Does this separation between the "blueprint" of properties and the "work order" of constructors help clarify why the parameters are needed?

---

**User**

Yeah... but like... they don't DEMAND a List<Item> so what exactly is the actual difference? Is it just a safeguard if data is lost along the way somehow? To me it sounds like they only NEED those two, and like... *confused face*

---

**Cursor**

You are absolutely correct. The `Character` constructor does not *demand* a `List<Item>` as an incoming parameter. That is the key difference.

Think of it this way:
*   `name` and `health` are **External Requirements**. They are values that must be provided from the outside world every time a new `Character` is created. You cannot build a `Character` without knowing what its name and health should be.
*   `Inventory` is an **Internal Detail**. It is a property that every `Character` should have, but its initial state is always the same: a new, empty list. It doesn't need any information from the outside. The `Character` class can handle creating the empty inventory by itself.

So, the constructor's parameters represent the data that the class cannot possibly know on its own and therefore must be supplied.

Now, let's return to the original question. The `Character` constructor runs first and creates an empty inventory. Then, the `Player` constructor runs and also creates an empty inventory. What is the result of this sequence of events?

---

**User**

Just redundant code, I don't see any fewer errors if I remoe the inventory line from the Player class

---

**Cursor**

You are correct. Removing the line `this.Inventory = new List<Item>();` from the `Player` and `NPC` constructors will not fix any compiler errors.

This is because it is not a *syntax* error; it is a *logic* error. The code is wasteful. It creates a new list, and then immediately throws it away and replaces it with another new list. Removing the line makes the code cleaner and more efficient. It is the correct action to take.

Now that your `Character`, `Player`, and `NPC` classes are correctly structured, the original errors in that file should be gone. However, changing a class's constructor often creates a ripple effect.

If you have changed the work order for how to build a `Player`, what do you think has happened to the part of the code in `Program.cs` that was using the *old* work order?

---

**User**

So if I create an instance of a potential new subclass for Character that doesn't include details for Inventory they won't get one?

---

**Cursor**

That is an excellent and insightful question.

Because you have placed the line `this.Inventory = new List<Item>();` inside the `Character` constructor, any class that inherits from `Character` *will* get an inventory.

Remember the sequence:
1.  You call the constructor for your new subclass, `public class Slime : Character`.
2.  Your `Slime` constructor *must* call `: base(name, health)`.
3.  The `Character` constructor runs in its entirety. It sets the `Name`, `Health`, and `Inventory`.
4.  The `Slime` constructor finishes.

So, even if your `Slime` class has no code in it other than its constructor, it will still have a `Name`, `Health`, and a fully initialized `Inventory` list because the `Character` blueprint and its constructor provide them.

You have guaranteed that every single `Character` in your game will have an inventory. What does this tell you about the power of placing initialization logic in a base class constructor?

---

**User**

But... it's not required. Sorry, this is super confusing. I don't see the practical difference if by defaul all that information will be sent one way or the other anyway

---

**Cursor**

I understand. The confusion is valid because the distinction is subtle but fundamental. Let's focus on the difference between information that must be supplied *externally* versus information that can be handled *internally*.

A constructor's purpose is to ensure an object is created in a valid, predictable state.

1.  **External Information (Parameters):**
    -   When you create a new character, will its name always be the same? No. The code that calls `new Player(...)` or `new NPC(...)` is what determines the name.
    -   Because the `Character` class cannot possibly guess what the name should be, it **requires** that information to be passed in as a parameter. The same is true for `health`.

2.  **Internal Information (Body Logic):**
    -   When you create a new character, will its starting inventory always be the same? Yes. In our design, it is always a new, empty list.
    -   Because the `Character` class already knows exactly what to do (`new List<Item>()`), it does not need to ask for this information. It can handle this initialization internally.

The parameters are "required" because they represent the essential data that the class cannot provide for itself. The inventory is not a parameter because the class *can* provide it for itself without any outside help.

You are creating a contract that says: "To build a Character, you must tell me its name and health. I will handle giving it an empty inventory automatically."

Does this distinction between external (variable) data and internal (fixed) data clarify the design?

---

**User**

That clarified a lot, thanks. Did this teach you anything about what I mgiht have trouble with? Can you give me a line to add to your @mcp.json so we avoid wasting time in confusion ?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, this interaction was very instructive. It has shown me that you build a stronger understanding when we explicitly separate the abstract *design principle* (the 'why') from the concrete *language mechanics* (the 'how'). The confusion arose when these two concepts became entangled.

To help me remember this distinction and better adapt to your learning style, you can add the following line to the `rules` array in your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
"## DISTINGUISH PURPOSE FROM MECHANICS: When the student expresses confusion, explicitly differentiate between the design goal (the 'why') and the C# language mechanics (the 'how'). Use analogies to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete code."
```

Now, let's apply this. We have successfully refactored the `Character` and `Player` classes. The constructor for `Player` has been changed.

Considering that `Program.cs` was using the old constructor to create a player instance, what do you now expect to find in that file?

```json
"## DISTINGUISH PURPOSE FROM MECHANICS: When the student expresses confusion, explicitly differentiate between the design goal (the 'why') and the C# language mechanics (the 'how'). Use analogies to bridge the gap between abstract concepts and concrete code."
```

---

**User**

I think it's fine honestly, you can take a look

---

**Cursor**

You are right to be confident. The constructor for `Player` still requires a name and a health value, just as it did before. The underlying mechanics of how the object is constructed have changed, but the "public-facing" contract has not. Therefore, the existing code in `Program.cs` should still be valid.

I will read the file to confirm.

You are correct. The line `thePlayer = new Player(playerName, 100);` is perfectly valid. The refactoring you performed was internal to the class structure and did not change the public contract for creating a `Player` instance. This is a great example of good encapsulation.

We have successfully refactored the `Player` class and explored the fundamentals of inheritance. We can now return to our original plan in `next_steps.md`. The next task involves applying these same concepts to the `Item` class.

I will read the `Item.cs` file to refresh our memory on its current state.

Alright, looking at `Item.cs`, I see you have already started applying the principles of inheritance. You've created a `HealingItem` class that inherits from `Item` and a `UseItem` class. This is good progress.

However, similar to our `Character` refactoring, there are a few structural issues and redundancies here. The file currently contains three separate class definitions, and the `Use` logic is not yet correctly placed.

Let's focus on the first goal from `next_steps.md`: making `Item` a proper abstract blueprint. We have already made the class `abstract`. What was the next step required to ensure that every class that inherits from `Item` must have a `Use` method?

That is an exceptionally sharp observation. You have pinpointed the exact issue.

You are correct that this code would produce an error, and your reasoning is sound: the constructor has no way of knowing what values to assign to `Name` and `Health`.

The error would happen even before you could run the program. The C# compiler itself would stop you. When the compiler looks at the line `this.Name = name;` inside your parameterless constructor, what crucial piece of information is it missing about the `name` variable?

---

**User**

The value

---

**Cursor**

Correct. And from the compiler's perspective, before it can even think about the *value*, it must first know that the variable `name` even exists.

Where in a method or constructor is a variable like `name` typically introduced and defined so that the code inside the curly braces `{}` can access it?

---

**User**

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Name can be simplified
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

**Cursor**

That suggestion is a code style recommendation from the IDE, not a compiler error. It indicates that a piece of code can be written more concisely without changing its meaning.

The `this` keyword is used to clarify that you are referring to a member of the class, which is especially useful when a constructor parameter has the exact same name as a class field.

C# is a case-sensitive language. With that in mind, what difference do you notice between the constructor parameter `name` and the class field `Name`?

---

**User**

Not every item must have a use method.

---

**Cursor**

You have raised a crucial point in game design. You are correct; not every item needs to be "usable" in the traditional sense. Some items might be passive, some might be quest items that are simply held, and some might be crafting materials.

This is where we must choose the right tool for the job. Our current tool, the `abstract` method, creates a very strict rule: "Every single class that inherits from `Item` *must* implement a `Use` method."

If we want a more flexible system, we have two primary options:

1.  **A `virtual` method**: We could define a default `Use` method in the `Item` base class and mark it as `virtual`. This would allow child classes to `override` it if they need to, but they would not be forced to. A "useless" item would simply inherit the default, perhaps empty, `Use` behavior.

2.  **An `interface`**: We could create a contract called `IUsable` that contains the `Use` method signature. Then, only the classes that we want to be usable would implement this interface. A `Key` would be an `IUsable` `Item`, but a `QuestScroll` might just be an `Item`.

Both are valid designs. The `virtual` method approach is simpler, while the `interface` approach is more flexible and scalable.

Given that our current goal is to learn the fundamentals of inheritance, which approach seems like a more direct application of the concepts we have been discussing?

---

**User**

I think you need to take a look at the file again @Item.cs 

---

**Cursor**

You are correct. I will re-examine the file to address the current structure and the error you are encountering.

Thank you for the correction. Looking at the current code, I can see the source of the linter error and the structural confusion.

The error message "An object reference is required..." is appearing on the line `this.HealAmount = HealingItem.HealAmount;`. This is because `HealingItem` is a class (a blueprint), but `HealAmount` is a property that only exists on a specific *instance* of that class. You are trying to get a value from the blueprint instead of from an actual object.

This points to a larger design issue. Your goal is to define how an item is used, but the `Use` logic is currently in a separate class called `UseItem` instead of being part of the `HealingItem` itself.

An object should be responsible for its own behavior. Therefore, where should the `Use` method that defines the behavior of a `HealingItem` be located?

---

**User**

Can you try and refer to the book so I can read up on this, and try to use the language and phrasing from there as much as possible.

---

**Cursor**

Of course. According to the C# Player's Guide, "Objects are made out of data and the operations that can be performed on that data." (Part 2, Chapter 15, "Object-Oriented Concepts").

Your `HealingItem` class contains data: `Name`, `Description`, and `HealAmount`. The operation you want to perform on that data is `Use`. To follow the principle of encapsulation, the data and the operations on that data should be bundled together.

Therefore, the `Use` method, which is the operation, belongs inside the `HealingItem` class, which holds the data.

How would you move the `Use` method from the `UseItem` class and place it inside the `HealingItem` class?

---

**User**

Why would I do that? I can't imagine the difference

---

**Cursor**

That is a fair question. The difference lies in the fundamental concept of encapsulation, which is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

Imagine you have a physical television remote. The data is the current volume level, and the methods are the `IncreaseVolume()` and `DecreaseVolume()` buttons.

*   **Your current design (`UseItem` class):** This is like having a separate "Universal Remote User" person. To change the channel, you must find this person and tell them which remote to use. The remote itself has no buttons; it's just a plastic case holding a number. This is confusing and indirect.

*   **The encapsulated design (placing `Use` inside `HealingItem`):** This is the normal television remote. The buttons (`Use` method) are on the remote itself. If you have the remote, you have the ability to use it directly. The data (volume) and the operations (buttons) are bundled together in a single, logical unit.

By placing the `Use` method inside the `HealingItem` class, you are ensuring that any `HealingItem` object automatically carries its own behavior with it. This makes the code more intuitive, reusable, and less prone to errors.

Given this principle of bundling data and behavior, does it now seem more logical to place the `Use` method within the `HealingItem` class?

---

**User**

Sure. But I don't see a way to creating various potions with different levels of healing this way .I just see one random healing object that will take on whatever value HealAmount is in general from the HealingItem class unless I instance an object at which point I feel it's too late because that feels like a temporary non-existent item (one that is just instanced and exists only within the main function for example seems like absolute nonsense to me since I'd ahve no way to track the information on the differen item without scrolling through varous .cs files in hopes of finding a MOMENT where it's instanced

---

**Cursor**

You have articulated the exact challenge that constructors are designed to solve. Your concern is valid: how do we create distinct items if the logic seems to be in one place?

The confusion stems from viewing the `HealingItem` class as a single object. Instead, let's follow the C# Player's Guide's core idea: a class is a *blueprint* or a *template*.

Imagine the `HealingItem` class is a cookie cutter. It defines the shape of a "healing cookie," but it knows nothing about the flavor of the dough or the color of the icing you will use for any specific cookie.

The `HealAmount` property is like the flavor. It does not belong to the cookie cutter itself; it belongs to the individual cookie you create with it.

You have already written the code that provides these unique details when an object is created. Looking at your `HealingItem` class, what is the name of the special method that you wrote to receive the `Name`, `Description`, and `HealAmount` for a new instance?

---

**User**

No. I get that Classes are blueprints but I mean wtf is this supsoed to be. They're constructors but to crteate fucking what exactly? 

---

**Cursor**

That is the right question to ask. A constructor is a set of instructions for building something. The `new` keyword is what actually starts the construction process.

Let's look at the `HealingItem` constructor you wrote. It is a blueprint that says: "To create a `HealingItem`, you must provide me with a name, a description, and a specific healing amount."

You can use this single blueprint to create many different, unique items. In your `Program.cs` file, or wherever you give items to the player, you would use the `new` keyword:

```csharp
// Create an instance of a "Small Potion" using your blueprint.
HealingItem smallPotion = new HealingItem("Small Potion", "A common potion that restores a bit of health.", 20);

// Create an instance of a "Greater Potion" using the same blueprint.
HealingItem greaterPotion = new HealingItem("Greater Potion", "A rare and potent elixir.", 100);
```
Here, `smallPotion` and `greaterPotion` are two completely separate objects. They were built from the same `HealingItem` blueprint, but because you provided different data to their constructors, they now have their own unique `Name`, `Description`, and `HealAmount` values.

Does seeing how the `new` keyword uses the constructor blueprint to create distinct objects clarify how you can have various potions with different healing levels?

```csharp
// Create an instance of a "Small Potion" using your blueprint.
HealingItem smallPotion = new HealingItem("Small Potion", "A common potion that restores a bit of health.", 20);

// Create an instance of a "Greater Potion" using the same blueprint.
HealingItem greaterPotion = new HealingItem("Greater Potion", "A rare and potent elixir.", 100);
```

---

**User**

Yeah, but I mean wtf do you mean "wherever you give items to the player" that soundslike an ABSOLUTE  NIGHTMARE to navigate as  adeveloper

---

**Cursor**

You are absolutely right to be concerned about that. Hard-coding `new HealingItem(...)` in random places throughout the project would indeed be a nightmare to manage. A well-structured program needs a centralized and organized way to handle item creation.

This is a common challenge in game development, and it is often solved by creating a dedicated class whose sole responsibility is to create other objects. This is known as the **Factory Pattern**.

Imagine a class named `ItemFactory`. It could have a method like `Create(string itemName)`.

```csharp
public static class ItemFactory
{
    public static Item Create(string itemName)
    {
        if (itemName == "Small Potion")
        {
            return new HealingItem("Small Potion", "Restores 20 health.", 20);
        }
        if (itemName == "Rusty Key")
        {
            return new Key("Rusty Key", "Opens a simple lock."); // Assuming a Key class exists
        }
        // ... and so on for every item in the game
        return null; // or throw an error if the item name is unknown
    }
}
```
With this approach, you are no longer scattering `new` statements everywhere. Instead, whenever you need an item, you go to one single place: the `ItemFactory`.

`Item myNewItem = ItemFactory.Create("Small Potion");`

Does this concept of a centralized "Item Factory" seem like a more organized and manageable way to handle item creation?

```csharp
public static class ItemFactory
{
    public static Item Create(string itemName)
    {
        if (itemName == "Small Potion")
        {
            return new HealingItem("Small Potion", "Restores 20 health.", 20);
        }
        if (itemName == "Rusty Key")
        {
            return new Key("Rusty Key", "Opens a simple lock."); // Assuming a Key class exists
        }
        // ... and so on for every item in the game
        return null; // or throw an error if the item name is unknown
    }
}
```

---

**User**

it wouldn't need to be an abstract itemfactory class for my goals?

---

**Cursor**

That is a very sharp question. You are thinking ahead about how to structure this new class.

In this case, an `abstract` class would not be the correct tool. An `abstract` class is a blueprint that is meant to be inherited by other classes. An `ItemFactory` is not a blueprint for other types of factories; it is a concrete, standalone utility.

You are creating a tool, not a template. Therefore, a `static` class is the ideal choice here. A `static` class is a collection of methods that can be called directly without ever needing to create an instance of the class with the `new` keyword.

Think of it this way:
*   You create `new Player()` because you can have multiple, different player objects.
*   You would not create a `new ItemFactory()` because there is only one "item factory" in your game world. It is a single, global utility.

Does the distinction between an instantiable class (like `Player`) and a static utility class (like `ItemFactory`) make sense for this use case?

---

**User**

Ok. I think I get what that tool is supposed to do and maybe that's enough for our use cases considering the limited graphical UI and scope of the game

---

**Cursor**

I agree. The `ItemFactory` pattern provides the organization we need without adding unnecessary complexity.

Let's put this concept on hold for a moment. It is a powerful tool for organizing a large project, but we must first ensure our base `HealingItem` class is working correctly. We can create the factory later.

Let's return to the `Item.cs` file. The primary issue is that the `Use` method is not correctly defined and is not yet part of the `HealingItem` class.

According to the plan in `next_steps.md`, all items should have a `Use` method. The most direct way to enforce this is to first declare an `abstract` `Use` method in the base `Item` class.

What would be the correct syntax for an `abstract` method named `Use` that accepts a `Character` object and returns nothing?

---

**User**

I mean, I put it like this.

---

**Cursor**

You have correctly placed a `Use` method inside the `HealingItem` class. This is a significant step towards proper encapsulation.

However, the code inside the method is not yet correct. It currently reads:
```csharp
this.Name = Name;
this.HealAmount = HealAmount;
```
This code simply assigns a property's value back to itself.

Let's think about the *purpose* of using a healing potion. What property of the `character` object should this method modify, and how should it use the `HealAmount` from the potion to do so?

```csharp
this.Name = Name;
this.HealAmount = HealAmount;
```

---

**User**

Like this? 

---

**Cursor**

You have correctly changed the parameter from `Character` to `Player`. This is a valid design choice if you decide that items can only be used on the player.

However, the logic inside the method remains the same. The lines `this.Name = Name;` and `this.HealAmount = HealAmount;` do not affect the `player` object in any way.

The goal of this method is to modify the state of the `player`. Specifically, what property on the `player` object should increase when a `HealingItem` is used?

---

**User**

Health

---

**Cursor**

Correct. The `Health` property on the `player` object should be increased.

You have a variable named `player` that represents the character using the item. How do you access the `Health` property that belongs to that `player` object?

---

**User**

Like this?

---

**Cursor**

That is a great step forward. The line `player.Health = HealAmount;` correctly accesses the player's `Health` property and changes it.

However, this line *sets* the player's health to be exactly equal to the potion's `HealAmount`. If the player has 50 health and uses a potion that heals for 20, this code would set their health to 20, not 70.

What arithmetic operator should you use to *add* the `HealAmount` to the player's current health?

---

**User**

        player.Health = player.Health + HealAmount;

---

**Cursor**

That is exactly right. That line of code correctly performs the calculation.

C# also provides a more concise shorthand for this operation: `player.Health += HealAmount;`. This compound assignment operator does the exact same thing as the code you wrote.

Now, you have a perfectly working `Use` method for your `HealingItem`. But what if you create a `Key` class or a `TeleportStone` class? Right now, there is nothing that forces those new classes to also have a `Use` method.

How can we modify the `Item` base class to create a rule that *requires* every single subclass of `Item` to have its own implementation of a `Use` method?

---

**User**

I could just create a new subclass that incorporates that. 

---

**Cursor**

That is a valid line of thought. You could indeed create another subclass, perhaps named `UsableItem`, that inherits from `Item` and then have classes like `Key` and `Potion` inherit from `UsableItem`.

This creates a chain: `Key` inherits from `UsableItem`, which inherits from `Item`. This is a legitimate, though somewhat complex, design pattern.

However, there is a more direct tool that C# provides to enforce a rule on all direct children of a base class.

Within the `Item` class itself, what keyword can we add to a method declaration to define a rule that all child classes must follow, without providing any implementation in the base class?

---

**User**

I dont know

---

**Cursor**

That is perfectly fine. The keyword is `abstract`.

Just as you can have an `abstract class`, you can also have an `abstract method` inside it. An `abstract` method is a method declaration without a body (`{...}`). It serves as a formal contract.

By placing `public abstract void Use(Player player);` inside your `Item` class, you are making a powerful statement: "Any non-abstract class that wishes to be an `Item` *must* provide its own `Use` method. I will not provide a default one."

This is the rule that ensures a `Key`, a `Potion`, or any other item you create in the future will have the `Use` functionality defined.

Given this, what two changes do you need to make? One in the `Item` class to establish the rule, and one in the `HealingItem` class to comply with it?

---

**User**

Alright. One question I haven't asked but feel compelled to is, are the items required to actually use the things like "Use" just because it's available to them? Could I simply not utilize that part in passive items?

---

**Cursor**

That is an excellent and very important design question.

If you use an `abstract` method in the `Item` base class, you are creating a strict, mandatory rule. Every single child class—whether it's an active `Potion` or a passive `Amulet`—will be *forced* by the compiler to have a `Use` method. You would have to provide a `Use` method for your passive items, even if the method body is completely empty.

This design is simple, but it is not very flexible.

If you want to create a system where some items are usable and others are not, you have two better options:

1.  **`virtual` method**: You can provide a default, empty `Use` method in the `Item` class and mark it as `virtual`. Active items like `Potion` can then `override` this method with real logic, while passive items can simply ignore it and inherit the empty default behavior.

2.  **`interface`**: You can create a contract called `IUsable` that contains the `Use` method. Then, only the items you want to be usable will implement the `IUsable` interface. This is the most flexible approach, as it completely separates the concept of "being an item" from "being usable."

Both are valid solutions. The choice depends on whether you want a simple system with a default behavior (`virtual`) or a more flexible, decoupled system (`interface`). Which of these two options seems more appealing for your game's design?

---

**User**

Why can't i just fucking have one class that's non-passive and one that is???????¨'

---

**Cursor**

You can.

That is an excellent design solution. It is clear, logical, and a perfect use of inheritance.

Let's formalize your idea. We can have:
1.  A base `Item` class that holds properties common to all items, like `Name` and `Description`.
2.  A `PassiveItem` class that inherits from `Item`.
3.  A `UsableItem` class that also inherits from `Item`.

This structure perfectly separates your items into the two categories you identified. Now, the key difference is that a `UsableItem` must have a `Use` method, while a `PassiveItem` must not.

How can you define the `UsableItem` class to enforce the rule that any class inheriting from *it* (like a `Potion` or a `Key`) must have a `Use` method?

---

**User**

Alright. Let's try [GENERATE_SOLUTION]. Do that, and then use Mermaid to ensure you can point back and forth withthe logic and why things are the way they are.

---

**Cursor**

Understood. I will now generate the solution based on your design.

First, I will refactor the `Item.cs` file to implement the clear, hierarchical structure you defined.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// The base blueprint for all items in the game. It cannot be created on its own.
/// It defines the properties that ALL items must have.
/// </summary>
public abstract class Item
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public string Description { get; }

    protected Item(string name, string description)
    {
        this.Name = name;
        this.Description = description;
    }
}

/// <summary>
/// A blueprint for items that can be actively used.
/// It introduces the mandatory "Use" method contract.
/// </summary>
public abstract class UsableItem : Item
{
    // By calling base(), we pass the information up to the Item constructor.
    protected UsableItem(string name, string description) : base(name, description) { }

    // This abstract method forces any child class (like HealingItem) to implement the Use logic.
    public abstract void Use(Player player);
}

/// <summary>
/// A blueprint for items that have no active use.
/// </summary>
public class PassiveItem : Item
{
    // It simply calls the base constructor to get its Name and Description.
    public PassiveItem(string name, string description) : base(name, description) { }

/// <summary>
/// A specific, concrete implementation of a UsableItem.

public class HealingItem : UsableItem

    public int HealAmount { get; }

    // It gets all required data and passes the item-specific parts to its base constructor.
    public HealingItem(string name, string description, int healAmount) : base(name, description)
    {
        this.HealAmount = healAmount;
    }

    /// <summary>

    {
        player.Health += this.HealAmount;
        Console.WriteLine($"You use the {this.Name} and recover {this.HealAmount} health. You now have {player.Health} health.");

The solution has been generated. The `Item.cs` file is now structured according to your design, and an error has appeared as a result of our changes. The diagram below illustrates the new class hierarchy.

```mermaid

    direction TD

    class Item {
        <<abstract>>
        +string Name
        +string Description
    }

    class UsableItem {
        <<abstract>>
        "Inherits from Item"
        +Use(Player player)*
    }
    
    class PassiveItem {
        "Inherits from Item"
        ...
    }

    class HealingItem {
        "Inherits from UsableItem"
        +int HealAmount
        +Use(Player player)
    }
    
    Item <|-- UsableItem
    Item <|-- PassiveItem
    UsableItem <|-- HealingItem

    note for UsableItem "This class adds the abstract Use() rule.<br/>Any item that can be used must inherit from this."
    note for HealingItem "This class follows the rule by providing<br/>a concrete implementation of the Use() method."
    note for PassiveItem "This class has no Use() method because<br/>it inherits directly from Item and not UsableItem."
```

The error message "There is no argument given that corresponds to the required parameter 'name' of 'Item.Item(string, string)'" is now present in a class named `ToUseItem`.

Based on our new design, what purpose does the `ToUseItem` class now serve, and what should be done with it?

```mermaid
classDiagram
    direction TD

    class Item {
        <<abstract>>
        +string Name
        +string Description
    }

    class UsableItem {
        <<abstract>>
        "Inherits from Item"
        +Use(Player player)*
    }
    
    class PassiveItem {
        "Inherits from Item"
        ...
    }

    class HealingItem {
        "Inherits from UsableItem"
        +int HealAmount
        +Use(Player player)
    }
    
    Item <|-- UsableItem
    Item <|-- PassiveItem
    UsableItem <|-- HealingItem

    note for UsableItem "This class adds the abstract Use() rule.<br/>Any item that can be used must inherit from this."
    note for HealingItem "This class follows the rule by providing<br/>a concrete implementation of the Use() method."
    note for PassiveItem "This class has no Use() method because<br/>it inherits directly from Item and not UsableItem."
